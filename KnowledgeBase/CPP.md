# C++
In most of my day to day programming I mainly use a small subset of C++
features. C++ is the best thing out there for many things as it offers
the programmer more control through low-level programming etc. For any
serious video-game engine there is not many options when it comes to
programming languages. Still I opt for not following the Modern C++ standard
and instead use a subset of C++ and this is why I want to document through
this markdown document my reasons for doing so.

Most comparisons will be to the C language but some comparisons will be made
with other low-level languages such as Go, D and Rust. I will attempt to
document both the good parts and the bad parts of C++ as well as collecting
resources for those who want to further investigate some of the topics 
that are discussed within this document.

In addition to documenting C++ features I want to collect code snippets
patterns and practices which could be overall useable for C++ programmers.
Some parts of this document will be highly oppinionated. For those parts I 
will try to add a disclaimer and keep the main content as information only.

## New things in C++
Compared to C, C++ brought a lot of new things to the table such as 
generics, lambdas, operator & function overloading, exceptions, RAII, const
correctness and a standard library. In this section I want to go through
some of the new things added in C++ which is not available in C.

### RAII
TODO
### Exceptions
TODO
### Templates
TODO
### Operator overloading / Function overloading
TODO
### Lambda

## Reading resources for C/C++
This part of the document will contain a list of recomended reading 
resources for those interesting in learning more about the language as well
as different areas of programming relative to what I'm working with.

* The C Programming Language - Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie
* The C++ Programming Language - Bjarne Stroustrup
* Effective C++ - Scott Meyers
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Harold Abelson & Gerald Jay Sussman
