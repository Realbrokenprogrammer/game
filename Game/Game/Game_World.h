		Layers:
		1 - Foreground General 2
			Tiles can't be placed here. Objects can't kill you. This is most for foreground looks / paralax.
		2 - Foreground Tile
			Tile layer that goes over the main ground layer. Might be used to hide things. Player won't interract with this.
		3 - Foreground Tile General
			Can't place tiles here but you can place objects.
		4 - Active Tile
			Everything is collideable here. Player will interract with objects and tiles here.
		5 - Back Tile General
			Mostly for objects. Things you want to place behind walls like traps etc.
		6 - Back Tile
			Background tiles.
		7 - Back General 2
			For paralax.
		8 - Back General 3
			For background.
		
		Props:
			* Rocks

		Animated props:
			* Rain
			* Clouds

		Objects: - Usually things you interract with or kill you.
			* End level object. (Object you touch to "win")
			* Traps, saws, lava.
			NOTE: Should be able to set a start and finish destination to make the object move between those positions.
